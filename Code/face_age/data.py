"""Dataset loading and canonical-schema harmonization for the age classifier.

PIVOT (2026-07, recorded honestly rather than silently patched):
    The originally planned anchor, FairFace, was to be downloaded from Kaggle
    package "abdulwasay551/fairface-race". On inspection that package has NO
    age/gender labels anywhere (no CSV; train/val are organized by race-folder
    only, with plain sequential filenames) and train_aligned/val_aligned turned
    out to be a MIX of re-hosted UTKFace images (relabeled under race folders)
    and unlabeled stock photos. None of it is trustworthy ground truth for age.
    load_fairface() therefore detects this and refuses to silently use it.

    Revised design:
    - TRAIN + internal validation on UTKFace (age+gender+race all embedded in
      the filename, verified against real downloaded data). Not race-balanced
      like real FairFace would have been, but it is genuine, verifiable ground
      truth, which beats a "balanced" dataset with no usable labels at all.
    - TEST (external, held-out) on Adience — a different source (Flickr, not
      UTKFace's source), the model never sees it during training/tuning.
      Strong performance there is real cross-dataset generalization evidence.
    - If a properly labeled FairFace (with fairface_label_train/val.csv) is
      obtained later, load_fairface() already supports it unchanged and it can
      be added back in as a second external test set, or even swapped back in
      as the anchor if it arrives balanced and labeled as originally planned.

Every dataset is translated into ONE canonical schema so the rest of the code
can treat them uniformly. We keep the raw labels alongside the canonical ones
(`original_*` columns) plus `dataset_source` and `license`, so every row is
fully traceable — this is the provenance/lineage idea from data management.

Canonical columns produced by every loader:
    filepath        absolute path to the image on disk
    age_bin         one of AGE_BINS (9 FairFace bins)
    gender          "Male" | "Female"
    race_fine       one of RACE_FINE (7 FairFace races) or "Unknown"
    race_coarse     one of RACE_COARSE — the 5-way scheme ALL datasets share;
                    use THIS for cross-dataset fairness comparison
    dataset_source  "fairface" | "utkface" | "adience"
    split_hint      dataset's own split, e.g. "train"/"val" (FairFace only)
    original_age    raw age label as it appeared in the source
    original_gender raw gender label
    original_race   raw race label ("" for Adience — no race label exists)
    license         data-use terms (matters for the regulatory section)

NOTE on lossiness :
    - UTKFace has 5 race classes; FairFace has 7. UTKFace "Asian" cannot be
      split into East/Southeast Asian, and "Others" bundles several groups.
      So UTKFace race is only reliable at the COARSE level. race_fine for
      UTKFace is a best-effort approximation and is flagged as such.
    - Adience has NO race label at all -> race_fine/race_coarse = "Unknown".
      Adience rows must be EXCLUDED from any race-stratified fairness metric.
    - Age bins do not line up perfectly across datasets; Adience ranges that
      straddle two FairFace bins are mapped by midpoint (see ADIENCE_AGE_MAP).
